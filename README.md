#The File Integrity Checker is a Python-based desktop application developed using PyQt5, Hashlib, and QFileDialog libraries. The main objective of this tool is to check the integrity of any file (text, document, image, video, etc.) to ensure that the file has not been modified or tampered with. It uses the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) to calculate the hash value of a file and then compares it later to check whether the file has been altered or not.

The user interface (UI) has been designed using PyQt5 with a stunning red theme color to indicate that the application is built for high-level security purposes. The interface includes buttons with emojis, file selectors, and hash computation features, giving users a very interactive and modern experience.

The main purpose of the File Integrity Checker is to verify if a file has been modified, either intentionally or unintentionally, after it has been received or downloaded. This is particularly useful in:

Cybersecurity applications to ensure no malware/virus has modified the files.
File transfer validation to ensure the file received is the same as the sender sent.
Data security to detect unauthorized modifications or tampering of files.
Integrity checking for downloaded software, patches, and security updates.
